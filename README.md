# GIFOS âœ¨
First project of React Advanced's sprint from Acamica's Front End Development course.

## Goal
Create an app using Giphy's API to search gifs and enable changing from dark mode to light mode for user's preference.

## Stack
- [React](https://es.reactjs.org/): I used React to develop this project because it was one of its requirements, as well as using React with vainilla Javascript.
- [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/): I chose to use Scss as a stylesheet processor because of the easy way to manage classes and keep everything organized for each component.

### Credits

- [Animated spinner SVG](https://beta.designforventures.co/Free-Animated-SVG-Icons/)
